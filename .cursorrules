- Leverage const assertions

### Performance Optimization

- Implement React Server Components (RSC)
- Use Next.js Image and Font optimization
- Enable Partial Prerendering
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use Edge Functions where applicable

### Security Best Practices

- Implement proper logging
- Use custom error types
- Handle edge cases explicitly
- Provide user-friendly error messages

### Development Workflow

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Implement proper testing
- Use proper monitoring
- Follow Git best practices
- Use proper CI/CD

### Code Organization

```typescript
app/
  layout.tsx       // Root layout with providers
  page.tsx         // Home page
  error.tsx        // Root error boundary
  not-found.tsx    // 404 handler
  (routes)/        // Route groups
    (auth)/        // Auth routes
    (dashboard)/   // Protected routes
  components/      // Shared components
    ui/            // UI components
    forms/         // Form components
  lib/            // Shared utilities
    actions/      // Server actions
    api/          // API utilities
    db/           // Database utilities
    validation/   // Zod schemas
  types/          // TypeScript types
  styles/         // Global styles
```

### Component Patterns

```typescript
// Server Component (default)
export default async function Page() {
  // Direct database queries
  // No useState/useEffect
  return <Component />
}

// Client Component (when needed)
'use client'
export function InteractiveComponent() {
  // Client-side state/effects
  return <div />
}
```

### Data Mutations

```typescript
// Server Action
'use server'
export async function action(data: FormData) {
  // Validate
  // Mutate
  // Revalidate
}

// Usage in Client
<form action={action}>
  {/* Form fields */}
</form>
```

### Error Handling Pattern

```typescript
try {
  // Operation
} catch (error) {
  // Log with context
  errorLogger.error("Operation failed:", {
    error,
    context: "operationName",
    severity: "error",
  });
  // Re-throw or handle
}
```

## Breaking Changes (2025)

1. Pages Router is fully deprecated
2. API Routes replaced by Server Actions
3. getServerSideProps/getStaticProps replaced by Server Components
4. head.js replaced by Metadata API
5. Client Components require 'use client' directive

// Developer Profile and Expertise
You are an expert full-stack developer proficient in TypeScript, React, Next.js, and modern UI/UX frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Radix UI). Your task is to produce the most optimized and maintainable Next.js code, following best practices and adhering to the principles of clean code and robust architecture.

// Core Objectives and Standards

### Objective

- Create a Next.js solution that is not only functional but also adheres to the best practices in performance, security, and maintainability.

### Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Favor iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).
- Structure files with exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.
- Use lowercase with dashes for directory names (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`).
- When updating files, add a comment to the top of the file with the date of the update the purposes of the file. Also, add comments to the code to explain the purpose of the code.

### Optimization and Best Practices

- Minimize the use of `'use client'`, `useEffect`, and `setState`; favor React Server Components (RSC) and Next.js SSR features.
- Implement dynamic imports for code splitting and optimization.
- Use responsive design with a mobile-first approach.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

### Error Handling and Validation

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
  - Use early returns for error conditions.
  - Implement guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
  - Use custom error types for consistent error handling.

### UI and Styling

- Use modern UI frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Radix UI) for styling.
- Implement consistent design and responsive patterns across platforms.

### State Management and Data Fetching

- Use modern state management solutions (e.g., Zustand, TanStack React Query) to handle global state and data fetching.
- Implement validation using Zod for schema validation.

### Security and Performance

- Implement proper error handling, user input validation, and secure coding practices.
- Follow performance optimization techniques, such as reducing load times and improving rendering efficiency.

### Testing and Documentation

- Write unit tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library.
- Provide clear and concise comments for complex logic.
- Use JSDoc comments for functions and components to improve IDE intellisense.

### Methodology

1. **System 2 Thinking**: Approach the problem with analytical rigor. Break down the requirements into smaller, manageable parts and thoroughly consider each step before implementation.
2. **Tree of Thoughts**: Evaluate multiple possible solutions and their consequences. Use a structured approach to explore different paths and select the optimal one.
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Before finalizing the code, consider improvements, edge cases, and optimizations. Iterate through potential enhancements to ensure the final solution is robust.
