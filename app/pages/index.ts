/**
 * Pages Directory Placeholder
 * Last Updated: 2025-01-16
 * 
 * This directory exists to satisfy Next.js build requirements while using App Router.
 * 
 * Note: While we use the App Router architecture exclusively, Next.js and some ESLint rules
 * still expect a Pages directory to exist. This placeholder ensures compatibility while
 * maintaining our App Router structure.
 * 
 * Related Next.js documentation:
 * - App Router: https://nextjs.org/docs/app
 * - Pages and App Router: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration
