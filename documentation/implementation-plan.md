## Implementation Notes

### Schedule Generation Rules
1. Bi-weekly Schedule Periods
   - Generate schedules 1 month in advance
   - Support multiple draft versions
   - Only one active version per period

2. Shift Assignment Rules
   - Fixed shift times with pre-defined staffing requirements
   - Handle cross-midnight shifts in hours calculation
   - Track supervisor roles (can work as dispatcher)

3. Overtime Tracking
   - No maximum limit enforcement
   - Track history for reporting
   - Support approval workflow

### Database Considerations
1. Indexing Strategy
   - Optimize for date-based queries
   - Efficient employee schedule lookups
   - Support overtime history reporting

2. Data Integrity
   - Enforce schedule version control
   - Maintain overtime history
   - Track supervisor shift assignments

3. Performance Optimization
   - Partition large tables by date
   - Archive old schedules
   - Optimize cross-midnight calculations
